## 🧩 How Win32 APIs Are Called from Dart

**Windows API** was originally designed for **C** developers, so its conventions
reflect C's characteristics and capabilities. Fortunately, Dart has first-class
support for calling C code through **FFI** (Foreign Function Interface), which
is what `package:win32` builds on.

Dart's FFI support is split across two packages:

- [`dart:ffi`][dart:ffi] — the core library for declaring and calling native
  functions, working with pointers, and mapping C types to Dart types.
- [`package:ffi`][package:ffi] — higher-level helpers for common patterns like
  string conversion and memory allocation.

`package:win32` uses both internally, and you will often need them directly in
your own code as well.

## 📦 Installation

Add the required packages to your project:

<InstallPackagesCommand args="ffi win32" />

Then import them wherever you need to make Win32 calls:

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';

import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart';
import 'package:win32/win32.dart';
```

## 🚀 Calling Your First Win32 API

The [`Beep`][Beep] function is a good starting point — it takes a frequency in
Hz and a duration in milliseconds, and requires no memory management or error
handling:

```dart title="beep.dart"
import 'package:win32/win32.dart';

void main() {
  // highlight-next-line
  Beep(440 /* Hz */, 500 /* ms */);
}
```

Run this and you should hear an A<sub>4</sub> tone play for half a second.
