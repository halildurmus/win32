## 🛠️ Setting Up the Environment

### ⚙️ Requirements

- [Dart](https://dart.dev) version `3.5` or higher
- [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org) for generating changelogs
- [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) for managing Git hooks

If you're planning to contribute to the documentation, you'll also need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version `20` or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) version `10` or higher

Once your environment is ready, [fork the repository], clone it locally, and
set up the project.

### 📥 Cloning the Repository

Clone your fork of **win32** to your local machine:

```cmd title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/win32.git
```

### 📦 Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```cmd title="Terminal"
dart pub get
```

## 🧩 Setting Up Git Hooks

This project uses **Lefthook** to manage Git hooks. Install the hooks by running
the following in the project root:

```cmd title="Terminal"
lefthook install
```

This will set up checks that automatically ensure code quality and consistency
before commits.

### ✅ Running Tests

To run tests for the **win32** package, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the package directory:

   ```cmd title="Terminal"
   cd packages\win32
   ```

2. Run the tests with the following command:

   ```cmd title="Terminal"
   dart test -j 1 --test-randomize-ordering-seed=random
   ```

   - `-j 1`: Runs tests sequentially, increasing the likelihood of detecting
     segmentation faults or similar test failures.
   - `--test-randomize-ordering-seed=random`: Randomizes the test execution
     order to identify unintended dependencies between tests.

_We require tests for each feature or bug fix. If you’re unsure how to write_
_tests for your changes, feel free to ask on the relevant GitHub issue page._

## 📝 Contributing to the Documentation

Our documentation is built with [Docusaurus]. To contribute to the
documentation, you need to install the dependencies and start the development
server:

```cmd title="Terminal"
cd website
npm install
npm start
```

Now, head over `localhost:3000` to see the documentation.

:::simple Development Tip

To create a production build of the documentation, you can use the
`npm run build` command. Then, you can use the `npm run serve` command to serve
the production build on your local machine.

## 💻 Contributing to the **win32** Itself

If you want to contribute to the **win32** itself, follow the steps below:

### Classic Win32 APIs

- When wrapping a Win32 API, use the **Unicode** (`'W'`) wide variants of these
  APIs, rather than the **ANSI** (`'A'`) variants. For example:
  [CredWriteW][credwritew_link], rather than [CredWriteA][credwritea_link].

- To create a new API, _don't_ edit the main library files themselves; these get
  **overwritten**. Instead, edit the
  [win32_functions.json][win32_functions_json_link] file and run the
  `tools\generate.dart` script to update the library files:

  ```cmd title="Terminal"
  dart tools\generate.dart
  ```

- Structs can be **auto-generated** by including them in the
  [win32_structs.json][win32_structs_json_link] file and running the
  `tools\generate.dart` script, which will generate the corresponding Dart files.

  Once generated, compile the [struct_sizes.cpp][struct_sizes_cpp_link] on a
  `64-bit` machine architecture, typically using the
  [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt][command_prompt_link] with the
  following command (replace `xxxxx` with the installed Windows SDK build):

  ```cmd title="Terminal"
  cl /I "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.xxxxx.0\winrt" \
    tools\struct_sizes\struct_sizes.cpp
  ```

  Once compiled, run the resulting `struct_sizes.exe` file located in the
  project root to obtain struct sizes; copy the output directly into the
  `structSizeMap` within the [struct_sizes.dart][struct_sizes_dart_link] file,
  and finally, run the `tools\generate.dart` script to generate struct size
  tests for each struct.
- Constants belong in the [constants.dart][constants_dart_link]; please add
  documentation. In rare cases (where the constant is truly self-documenting),
  you may add to the [constants_nodoc.dart][constants_nodoc_dart_link], although
  the goal is to gradually document more constants.
- There are plenty of good existing patterns to build off in these locations;
  try to mirror an existing function if you can for consistency!
- Ideally pull requests for new API submissions include a **sample**
  (`examples\` directory) and **some tests** (`packages\win32\test\` directory).

### COM APIs

Begin by editing the [com_types.json][com_types_json_link] file, specifying the
desired COM interface, and then run the `tools\generate.dart` script to generate
the relevant class in the `packages\win32\lib\src\com` directory.

## 🚀 Committing Your Work and Preparing a Pull Request

To maintain a consistent and clean codebase, we enforce coding standards and use
tools to ensure high-quality contributions.

### 🎨 Coding Style

Please follow the [Dart style guide] to keep the codebase clean and consistent.

### 📜 Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits] to structure our commit messages for clarity and
uniformity.

Please use the following format for commit messages:

```text
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

Here's an example of a good commit message:

Examples:

- `feat: add DragQueryFile API`
- `fix: resolve an issue with the PROPVARIANT struct`

_Commit messages are validated with a GitHub action, so be sure to use the_
_correct format when making a pull request._

### 🧩 Git Hooks

The following hooks run automatically with Lefthook:

- **Pre-Commit Hooks**:
  - `analyze`: Checks code for style issues.
  - `format`: Formats code according to Dart guidelines.
  - `test_generator`: Runs tests for `package:generator` to ensure stability.
  - `test_win32`: Runs tests for `package:win32` to ensure stability.

- **Commit-msg Hook**:
  - `check_commit`: Ensures the commit message follows [Conventional Commits].

### 🔄 Creating a Pull Request

After committing your changes, push them to your fork and
[create a pull request]. When you open a pull request, tests will run
automatically, and our maintainers will review it.

Please use the pull request template to provide details about your changes,
ensuring a smoother review process.

Thank you for contributing to **win32**! 🎉
