/// A string data type that is commonly used by OLE Automation, as well as some
/// COM methods.
///
/// `BSTR` types differ from `Pointer<Utf16>` in that they include a four byte
/// prefix stored immediately prior to the string itself that represents its
/// length in bytes. The pointer points to the first character of the data
/// string, not to the length prefix.
///
/// `BSTR`s should never be created using Dart's memory allocation functions.
/// For instance, the following code is incorrect, since it does not allocate
/// and store the length prefix.
///
/// ```dart
/// final bstr = 'I am a happy BSTR'.toNativeUtf16();
/// ```
///
/// This class wraps the COM memory allocation functions so that `BSTR` types
/// can be created without concern. Instead of the above code, you can write:
///
/// ```dart
/// final bstr = BSTR.fromString('I am a happy BSTR');
/// ```
///
/// A debugger that examines the four bytes prior to this location will see a
/// 32-bit int containing the value 34, representing the length of the string in
/// Utf-16.
///
/// Dart does not garbage collect `BSTR` objects; instead, you are responsible
/// for freeing the memory allocated for a `BSTR` when it is no longer used. To
/// release its memory, you can call an object's [free] method.
