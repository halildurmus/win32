// Canonical Dart FFI aliases for Win32 primitive and pointer-sized types.
//
// This file defines the low-level building blocks used throughout the Win32
// API surface. Each alias mirrors its C / C++ counterpart exactly, preserving
// size, signedness, and ABI semantics.
//
// These aliases exist to:
//
// - Preserve correctness across 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
// - Make pointer-sized intent explicit (e.g., *_PTR types)
// - Improve readability when working with handles, buffers, and callbacks
// - Align Dart FFI code with official Win32 documentation and signatures
//
// These types are intentionally thin and allocation-friendly. They are designed
// to be used directly with `Allocator`, `Arena`, and pointer APIs:
//
// ```dart
// final result = adaptiveCalloc<DWORD>();
// SomeWin32Function(result);
// ```
//
// For authoritative definitions, see:
// https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types
//
